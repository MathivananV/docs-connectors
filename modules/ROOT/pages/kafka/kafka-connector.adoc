== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect 
to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, Kafka, ServiceNow,
and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must:

* Have access to the Kafka target resource and Anypoint Platform
* Understand how to create a Mule app using Design Center or Anypoint Studio
* Have access to Kafka to get values for the fields that appear in Studio and Design Center:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Group id |A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to.
|Bootstrap Servers |Comma-separated host-port pairs used for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. This is the same as the `bootstrap.servers` value you provide to Kafka clients (producer and consumer). If this property is provided with producer and consumer properties files, this value is ignored and the one from the properties file is used.
|===
