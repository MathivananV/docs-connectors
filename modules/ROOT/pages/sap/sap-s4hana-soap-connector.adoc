== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect 
to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, SAP S/4HANA SOAP Cloud, ServiceNow,
and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the SAP S/4HANA SOAP Cloud target resource and 
Anypoint Platform. You also need understand how to create a Mule app using 
Design Center or Anypoint Studio.

== Audience

* Starting user -- To create your Mule app,
see xref:sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-design-center.adoc[Design Center Configuration]
or xref:sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-studio.adoc[Studio Configuration].  The
xref:sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topic provides one or more use cases for using the connector.
* Power user - Read the xref:sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support],
and xref:sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topics.

== OAuth Types

Basic Authentication:: 
This is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials, which are encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.

== Input Sources (Triggers)

Anypoint Connector for SAP S/4HANA SOAP Cloud does not provide a source operation. You can use HTTP to listen for inputs or use a scheduler to choose when to run your app.

== Common Use Cases For the Connector

Send an XML request to SAP S/4HANA's SOAP API and print a response.

== Learn Using Exchange Templates and Examples

https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] provides templates
you can use as a starting point for your app, as well as examples that illustrate a complete solution.

== Next Step

After you have met the prerequisites and experimented with templates and examples, you are ready to create an app with
xref:sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-design-center.adoc[Design Center] or xref:sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].
