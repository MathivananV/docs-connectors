== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Default Configuration

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<Config_BasicAuthentication, Basic Authentication>> 
* <<Config_Oauth2Application, Oauth2 Application Connection Provider>> 
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Time Zone a| String |  The timezone with which the Date objects returned from S/4Hana will be converted. |  UTC | 
| Encoding a| String |  |  | 
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  | 
|===

==== Connection Types
[[config_basic-authentication]]
===== Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is the simplest way to enforce access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, which removes the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. Credentials are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.

====== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Service base URL a| String |  The base URL of the service on SAP S/4HANA to be accessed from the connector. All other endpoints are derived from this base URL. |  | x
| Username a| String |  The account username with which to log into SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Password a| String |  The account password with which to log into SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Discovery Service Enabled a| Boolean |  Feature switch for service discovery. If disabled, Service discovery relative path is not applied. |  true |
| Service discovery relative path a| String |  URL to use for automatic services discovery |  sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=0002/ServiceCollection |
| Service directory a| String |  Common HTTP directory for all SAP services. It is possible to leave this parameter blank and specify the HTTP directory individually for every service in the unlisted services list. |  |
| Unlisted services a| Array of String |  List of services that will be added to the list of discovered services. If the `Service directory` parameter is not specified, then the HTTP directory must be prepended before every service name in this list, in the following format: {directory}/{service-name}. |  |
| Default headers a| Array of <<defaultHeader>> |  Default HTTP headers to include in the message. |  |
| Default query parameters a| Array of <<defaultQueryParam>> |  Default Query parameters the request should include. |  |
| Proxy configuration a| <<ProxyConfiguration>> |  Proxy configuration for the connector. |  |
| TLS configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. When using HTTPS, the HTTP communication is secured using TLS / SSL. If HTTPS is configured as the protocol then, at a minimum, the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of this listener-config must be configured. | HTTP |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
