== Configurations

[[config]]
=== Default Configuration

==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_basic-connection, Basic Connection>>
| The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the configuration instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances based on internal criteria. |  |

== Types
[[Reconnection]]
=== Reconnection

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Fails Deployment a| Boolean | When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> | The reconnection strategy to use. |  |
|===

[[reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often in milliseconds to reconnect. | |
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts to make. | |
| blocking |Boolean |If false, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |true |
|===

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often in milliseconds to reconnect. | |
| blocking |Boolean |If false, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |true |
|===


[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that can be active at one time. When `maxActive` is exceeded, the pool is referred to as exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can remain idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that can be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the `exhaustedAction` is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object can sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When set to a non-positive number, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` 
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT` 
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL` a| Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted:

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` +
Creates a new Mule instance and returns it, which makes `maxActive` meaningless.
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT` +
Blocks by invoking `Object.wait(long)` until a new or idle object is available.
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL` +
Throws a `NoSuchElementException`

If a positive `maxWait` value is supplied, it will block for, at most, that many milliseconds, after which a `NoSuchElementException` will be thrown. If `maxThreadWait` is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  |
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

* `INITIALISE_NONE` 
* `INITIALISE_ONE` 
* `INITIALISE_ALL` a| Determines how components in a pool should be initialized:

* `INITIALISE_NONE` +
Will not load any components into the pool on startup 
* `INITIALISE_ONE` +
Will load one initial component into the pool on startup
* `INITIALISE_ALL` +
Will load all components in the pool on startup |  |

| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether to disable pooling. |  |
|===

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance is allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration. |  |
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the *Max idle time* attribute. |  |
