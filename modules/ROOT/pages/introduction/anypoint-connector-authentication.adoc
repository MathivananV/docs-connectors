To access system data, you need to authenticate your application’s requests. Depending on the specific connector, Anypoint connectors support the following authentication methods:

* <<basic_authentication,Basic authentication>>
* <<oauth,OAuth>>

[basic_authentication]
== Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is the easiest authentication method to implement becaue all you need to do is provide your credentials in a global configuration, then reference that global configuration in any $3 connectors in your application. Basic authentication is generally recommended for internal applications. 

[oauth]
== OAuth

OAuth is preferred if your service is exposed to external users, as it ensures better security for them.

The key benefit of OAuth is security for the end users of your service. Rather than supplying credentials directly to your third-party service (the OAuth client), a user issues security tokens that have limited scopes and duration. Giving a third-party service limited access to a user's account mitigates the account's exposure. The more places a user’s actual credentials are stored, the greater the chance of those credentials being used maliciously.
