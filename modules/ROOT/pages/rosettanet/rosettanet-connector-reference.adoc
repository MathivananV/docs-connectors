=== Configurations

The defaults for configurations and operations.

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Global HTTP Listener a| String |  Reference to the global HTTP Listener definition for our service endpoint used by partner for both action and signal messages.|  | x
| Service Endpoint Path a| String |  Service endpoint path, appended to base path on HTTP Listener.|  | x
| Global HTTP Request a| String |  Reference to the global HTTP Request definition for partner service endpoint used when sending both action and signal messages. |  | x
| Request Endpoint Path a| String |  Partner endpoint path, appended to base path on HTTP Request. |  | x
| Keystore path a| String |  Keystore containing trusted partner certificates and our own private signing key and certificate (JKS format).|  |
| Keystore access password a| String |  Keystore access password. |  |
| Signing key password a| String |  Private signing key password (required if signing either action or signal messages). |  |
| Override message signing a| Enumeration, one of:

** ALWAYS

| Global usage code a| Enumeration, one of:

** Test
** Production |  Choose whether operating in Test or Production mode, or if both allowed.|  Production|
| Object store reference a| Object Store |  Object store configuration reference. If not set the connector always uses the default persistent object store to retain sent messages waiting for acknowledgments or retries. If set, the referenced bean must be an object store configuration to use instead. |  |
| Mule DUNS identifier a| String |  DUNS business identifier for this organization. |  | x
| Mule location identifier a| String |  Location ID for this organization. If specified, this value is included in all messages sent and verified in all messages received. If not specified no value is sent and received values are ignored. |  |
| Partner DUNS identifier a| String |  Expected DUNS business identifier for partner organization.|  | x
| Partner location identifier a| String |  Expected location ID for partner organization. If specified, this value is included in all messages sent and verified in all messages received. If not specified no value is sent and received values are ignored. |  |
| Role in PIP a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIATOR

| PIP definition path a| String |  PIP file path.|  | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration.
This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate.|  |

| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which `maxInMemorySize is expressed`. |  |
|===
